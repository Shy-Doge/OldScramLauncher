# OldScramLauncher
This is the first Scram Launcher I've made. It's very basic offering only the option to launch 2019 and 2017 with basic Discord Rich Presence.
This launcher was discontinued since it was made using VB and because a "better" version with more possibilities and expandability was made.

The only reason why this is now public is for archival purposes since it is awful.
